## Understanding the problem
Although many face recognition algorithms have been developed over the years, their speed and accuracy balance has not been quiet optimal . But some recent advancements have shown promise. A good example is Facebook, where they are able to tag you and your friends with just a few images of training and with accuracy as high as 98%. So how does this work . Today we will try to replicate similar results using a face recognition library developed by Adam Geitgey. Lets look at the 4 problems he explained in his article.

Face recognition is a series of several problems:

1.First, look at a picture and find all the faces in it

2.Second, focus on each face and be able to understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.

3.Third, be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people— like how big the eyes are, how long the face is, etc.

4.Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the person’s name.
